Vanayana is a community-driven tree-planting platform designed to encourage sustainable practices and environmental conservation. Built using modern web technologies like the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), Cloudinary, Leaflet, and Lucide React, the platform provides both users and administrators with comprehensive tools for managing tree-planting campaigns.

Technologies Used
Frontend:
React.js: For building the user interface and handling state management.
Tailwind CSS: For styling components and ensuring responsiveness across devices.
Lucide React: For modern, lightweight icons.
Leaflet: For rendering interactive maps.
Backend:
Node.js: For server-side scripting.
Express.js: For creating RESTful APIs to interact with the database.
MongoDB: For storing campaign data such as descriptions, locations, and user inputs.
Cloudinary: For managing and optimizing media assets like campaign images.
